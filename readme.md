# Just-Another-DSA-Repo.

This repo covers my journey to learning the Data Structures and algorithms, after learning the basic
programming fundamentals.

- I have covered some additional topics, in the EXTRAs directory, which might help before starting your
  DSA journey.
- I have created separated directories for each topic.
- All the code and solved problems for each topic will be present in that directory.
