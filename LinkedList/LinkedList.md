## Just another linked list explaination.

- linear data structure.
- It is a series of conected nodes.
- Each node stores data and address of next node.

- The address of first node is called HEAD.
- The last node can be identified, as its NEXT (the address of next node) points to null.


# Doubly Linked list.
- Each node has address of previous node as well as next node.
- Working with doubly linked list is easier as you can move back and forth easily.

# Circular linked list.
- The last node is connected to first node making it a circular node.
- We are given just a single pointer that point to tale of the list.
